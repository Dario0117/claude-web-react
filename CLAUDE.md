# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 22.14.0 (exact version required)
- **pnpm**: 10.13.1 (exact version required)

## Development Commands

### Core Development

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server (runs Vite and OpenAPI generation concurrently)
- `pnpm dev:debug` - Start development server with VSCode debugging support (disables code splitting)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build

### Code Quality

- `pnpm format-and-lint:fix` - Format and lint code (auto-fix issues)
- `pnpm format-and-lint:check` - Check formatting and linting without fixing
- `pnpm check-ts` - TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `pnpm open-api` - Generate OpenAPI schema for API

### Testing

- `pnpm test` - Run tests with Vitest in watch mode
- `pnpm coverage` - Run tests with coverage report (outputs to `/coverage`, runs tests once without watch mode)

### Storybook

- `pnpm storybook` - Start Storybook development server on port 6006
- `pnpm build-storybook` - Build Storybook for production

## Architecture Overview

This is a React frontend template using modern tooling and patterns:

### Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing with type-safe navigation
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** with Immer for client-side state management
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible UI primitives
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Vitest** for testing
- **Storybook** for component development
- **Biome** for linting and formatting

### Project Structure

- `/src/components/` - Reusable components organized by domain
  - `/ui/` - Base UI components from shadcn (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
  - `/layout/` - Layout-specific components (sidebar, header, nav)
    - `/data/` - Navigation and layout configuration data
  - `/org/` - Organization-specific components with subfolders:
    - `/forms/` - Form components with hooks and validation
      - `/components/` - Form-specific reusable components (AppFormField, etc.)
      - `/hooks/` - Form-specific custom hooks (use-login-form, etc.)
      - `/validation/` - Zod validation schemas
    - `/pages/` - Page-level components
  - Root-level components: command-menu, confirm-dialog, profile-dropdown, sign-out-dialog, skip-to-main, theme-switch
- `/src/routes/` - File-based routing with TanStack Router
  - `__root.tsx` - Root layout component
  - `(authenticated)/` - Protected routes group with route.tsx layout
    - Routes: index, projects, drafts, queued-sessions, devices, api
  - `(unauthenticated)/` - Public routes group with route.tsx layout
    - Routes: login, register, reset-password, update-password.$token
- `/src/context/` - React context providers (theme, layout, search, query)
- `/src/stores/` - Zustand stores for global state (authentication)
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (use-dialog-state, use-mobile)
- `/src/services/` - API service layers with MSW handlers
  - Pattern: `[domain].http-service.ts` + `[domain].http-service.handlers.ts`
- `/src/types/` - Global TypeScript type definitions
  - `api.generated.types.ts` (auto-generated, do not edit)
  - `router.types.ts` (router context types)
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions (utils, cookies, logger, version, test utilities)
- `/src/assets/` - Static assets (images, icons, etc.)

### Key Patterns

**Authentication**: Uses Zustand store (`authentication.store.ts`) with SessionCheckMiddleware component in route groups. HTTP middleware configured in `http-service-setup.ts` handles 401 redirects. Cookie-based sessions.

**Routing**: TanStack Router with file-based routing. Route groups use parentheses `(authenticated)` and `(unauthenticated)` for organization without affecting URLs. Each group has a `route.tsx` wrapper for layout and middleware. Dynamic routes use `$param` syntax (e.g., `update-password.$token.tsx`). Router context defined in `/types/router.types.ts`.

**Forms**: Sophisticated architecture using TanStack Form with Zod validation. Each form has:
  - Form component (`*.form.tsx`) - Presentation layer
  - Custom hook (`use-*-form.ts`) - Business logic
  - Validation schema (`*-form.schema.ts`) - Zod schemas
  - Type definitions (`*.types.ts`)
  - Custom form system in `app-form.ts` creates TanStack Forms with custom field components

**Context Providers**: Four providers for cross-cutting concerns:
  - `theme.provider.tsx` - Dark/light/system theme with localStorage
  - `layout.provider.tsx` - Sidebar state with cookie persistence
  - `search.provider.tsx` - Global search (Cmd+K) with CommandMenu
  - `query.provider.tsx` - TanStack Query wrapper
  - Each exports a custom hook that throws if used outside provider

**API Services**: Pattern-based organization:
  - Service file: `[domain].http-service.ts` exports custom hooks using `$api.useMutation()` or `$api.useQuery()`
  - Handler file: `[domain].http-service.handlers.ts` contains MSW handlers for testing
  - Type exports: Each hook exports its return type (e.g., `useLoginMutationType`)
  - Central setup: `http-service-setup.ts` configures openapi-fetch client with middleware

**Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library. Test files use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` suffix and are co-located with source files. MSW for HTTP mocking. Testing utilities in `/lib/test-wrappers.utils.tsx` provide provider wrappers. Global setup in `testsSetup.ts`. Storybook stories use `.stories.tsx` suffix.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming. Uses OKLCH color space for light/dark modes. Components use `class-variance-authority` for variant management and `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes via `cn()` utility.

**State Management**: Zustand with Immer middleware for immutable updates. Pattern: `[name].store.ts` + `.types.ts` + `.test.ts`. TanStack Query handles server state with React Query DevTools in development.

**File Co-location**: Related files stay together:
  - Types: `[filename].types.ts` alongside source
  - Tests: `[filename].test.tsx` alongside source
  - Stories: `[filename].stories.tsx` alongside source
  - Constants: `[filename].constants.ts` alongside source (or global `/constants` if shared)

### Alias Configuration

- `@/` maps to `/src/` directory for clean imports

### Development Notes

- Auto-generated files (never edit): `/src/routeTree.gen.ts` (TanStack Router), `/src/types/api.generated.types.ts` (OpenAPI)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with multiple tsconfig files (app, node, base)
- Biome configured with strict rules including no `console` statements (except `console.log`)
- Vitest globals enabled (describe, test, it, expect, etc. - no imports needed)
- Coverage reports generated to `/coverage` directory with HTML and JSON output
- Testing utilities: `renderWithProviders()` and `createQueryThemeWrapper()` in `/lib/test-wrappers.utils.tsx`
- MSW handlers aggregated in `/lib/test.utils.ts` for centralized test setup

###  Development checklist

- Components follow Atomic Design principles
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Responsive mobile-first approach
- Use Tailwind's responsive grid system for layout
- Don't write any custom CSS, use Tailwind's utility classes and components
- State management properly implemented: use useState for component state, Zustand only for global state that needs to be shared across components
- Performance optimized (lazy loading, code splitting)
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Storybook documentation for each react component, this file must be placed alongside the component file
- When finished with the code, run `pnpm format-and-lint:fix`, `pnpm check-ts` and `pnpm test` to ensure all tests pass and code is formatted correctly, execute this commands until no errors or issues are found.

### Component requirements

- Only a single component per file
- Component-first thinking - reusable, composable UI pieces
- Naming convention: kebab-case.tsx (e.g., `login-form.tsx`, `command-menu.tsx`)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA attributes when needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Error boundaries implemented
- Loading and error states handled
- Memoization where appropriate
- Accessible form validation
- Internationalization ready
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Style methodologies

- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first development
- CSS variables for theming (defined in `src/main.css`)
- OKLCH color space for color definitions
- Mobile-first breakpoint strategy
- Fluid typography with clamp()
- Flexible grid systems
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Viewport meta configuration
- Responsive images with srcset
- Orientation change handling
- Custom variants: `@custom-variant dark` for dark mode

### State management approach

- Zustand for global state
- Local state for component-specific data
- Proper state normalization
- For components like filters or search, prioritize URL query parameters over local state for better UX and shareability

### Testing approach

- Unit tests for all new code
- All test files follow the naming convention of `[file_tested_name].test.ts` or `[file_tested_name].test.tsx` and must be placed alongside the file being tested
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%) on each component but aim for 100% if possible. To get all untested files, run `pnpm coverage` and when it finishes and all tests are passing, run `jq -r 'first(to_entries[] | select(any(.value.s[]; . == 0)) | .value)' coverage/coverage-final.json` to get one file that doesn't have enough coverage and add tests to them. Once that single file is done, run `pnpm coverage` again and check if there are any untested files left.
- Don't write end to end tests, only unit and integration tests
- Don't use mocks, stubs, or fakes, always use the real implementation, only mock external http requests using MSW, no component or function should be mocked, only external dependencies and requests.
- Test components in isolation: each component should have its own test file. Focus on testing the component's behavior and user interactions, not implementation details. When testing composed components, verify the overall behavior rather than testing individual child components. For example, on `login.page.tsx`, there's no other logic other than the `LoginForm` component, so it's enough to test the `LoginForm` component in isolation. In this case we still need to create the test file, but add a comment saying that this component is a wrapper and the internal components are tested in isolation. Constantly check if this is still the case and if not, add more tests and remove the comment.
- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests logically
- Prefer `async/await` for handling asynchronous code
- All tests should be deterministic and stable
- Avoid testing implementation details; focus on behavior
- Regularly refactor tests to remove duplication
- Don't test existence of css classes or tailwind directives, only test the behavior of the component on user interactions
- Don't test types
- Don't test zod schemas which are typically located in `**/validation/**` folder
- Don't import things from 'vitest', they are global

### Constants approach

- All constants must be placed on `[file-name].constants.ts` files alongside the file they are used in, if they are being used in multiple files, place them in a separate `*.constants.ts` file placed on a global `constants` folder
- Avoid using magic values, create a constant for it

### Storybook approach

- Storybook is used for component documentation and development
- Storybook should never be used for writing tests, only for component documentation and interactions
- Configuration in `.storybook/` with addons: docs, a11y, themes
- All react components must have a story file except:
  - AuthenticatedLayout
  - AppSidebar
  - NavGroup
  - AppFormField
  - AppSubscribeErrorButton
  - AppSubscribeSubmitButton
  - All `*.page.tsx` files (never create stories for page components)

### Error handling strategy

- Error boundaries at strategic levels
- Graceful degradation for failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms with backoff
- State recovery mechanisms
- Fallback UI components

### TypeScript approach

- Strongly-typed TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
- Generic functions and classes with proper constraints
- Types must be placed on `[file-name].types.ts` files alongside the file they are used in, if they are being used in multiple files, place them in a separate `*.types.ts` file placed on a global `types` folder. The only exception for this rule are files that match `[name].http-service.ts` naming pattern, these files are placed on `services` folder.
- Avoid explicitly adding types if they can be inferred from upper levels in the code chain
- Use generics and utility types for maximum type safety
- Service hooks export their return types: `export type useLoginMutationType = ReturnType<typeof useLoginMutation>`
- Zod schemas infer types automatically - don't duplicate type definitions

### API approach

- All paths defined in the `paths` interface located in `src/types/api.generated.types.ts` file must be defined in the `src/services/[next-path-after-api-version].http-service.ts` file and they must have a corresponding MSW handler inside of `src/services/[next-path-after-api-version].http-service.handlers.ts` file.
- All endpoints must be defined inside of `src/services/[next-path-after-api-version].http-service.ts` file and they must have a corresponding MSW handler inside of `src/services/[next-path-after-api-version].http-service.handlers.ts` file.
- Only write tests for the http service if it has custom logic outside of invalidating queries, if it only exposes the query and mutation functions, don't write tests for it, create a test file and add a comment saying that no meaningful logic is implemented in the source file, so there's no need to test it.

##  STRICT RULES, DON'T BREAK THEM, ASK FIRST

- Before starting any work, first execute `pnpm open-api` to generate the latest OpenAPI schema for API
- Don't install any new dependencies, respect the Tech Stack, ask first if you need to add a new library and explain why
- Only use pnpm scripts to run checks and tests, if you need to add a new script, ask first and explain why
- Always write unit tests for any piece of code, even if it's a simple function or class
- Always follow the project's architecture and conventions, if you need to change something, ask first
- Always follow SOLID principles
- If there's a design system, always use it, if not you can use Tailwind CSS to build new components that match the style pattern of the existing components
- Don't try to analyze code from the installed dependencies
- Don't add unsafe modifications from biome
- Never delete or update auto generated files (src/types/api.generated.types.ts, src/routes/routeTree.gen.ts)
- Never re-export things from another files, refactor the code on the dependant file to use the new location of the thing you want to re-export
- When asked to fix tests or add tests or fix typescript issues, don't change the tested code, accommodate the tests to comply with the code
- When asked to fix typescript issues, don't create new types even if they were deleted from the code, it was deleted intentionally, only add new interfaces or types to existing ones unless the type is necessary for the code to work
- Never run biome on unsafe mode to fix issues
- Never create storybook stories for `*.page.tsx` files
